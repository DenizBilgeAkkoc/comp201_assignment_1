all we'll hear no more to the capitol!
first citizen to the capitol! follow me.
second citizen peace, i say be not rash.
menenius good men, the wounds of your country are not balm'd by rage.
all speak, speak!
first citizen show us the man we'll answer him with our pikes.
menenius your valour is a song sung out of season.
all to the capitol! to the capitol!
