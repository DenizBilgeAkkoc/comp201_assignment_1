all no more talking on't let it be done away, away!
second citizen one word, good citizens.
first citizen we are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good. what authority surfeits on would relieve us if they would yield us but the superfluity, while it were wholesome, we might guess they relieved us humanely but they think we are too dear the leanness that afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an inventory to particularise their abundance our sufferance is a gain to them let us revenge this with our pikes, ere we become rakes for the gods know i speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge.
second citizen would you proceed especially against caius marcius?
all against him first he's a very dog to the commonalty.
